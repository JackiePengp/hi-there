# hi-there
Hi, I’m pengyang(Jackie), currently am working as operation role at Affine. 
Before joining Affine, I'm a guy with around 3years experiences in product operation within tiktok, which's mainly focusing on NLP/CV model training, deployment and successfully delivery.
I sometimes publish info/announcements regarding to Affine via our social media channel.
I’m looking forward to having more active engagements with anyone who may find Affine cool and intriguing to use. Thus, any problems, bugs, requirements, painpoints about Affine that beset you are always welcome to tell.
Anyone interested in Affine and wanting to do something to bring about some changes to the world is welcome to join Affine's ambassador plan(feel free to let know)
