# hi-there
Hi, I’m peng yang (Jackie), currently am working as an operational role at Affine. 
Before joining Affine, I'm a guy with around 3years of experience in product operation within TikTok, which's mainly focusing on NLP/CV model training, deployment, and successful delivery.
I sometimes publish info/announcements regarding Affine via our social media channel.
I’m looking forward to having more active engagements with anyone who may find Affine cool and intriguing to use. Thus, any problems, bugs, requirements, pain points about Affine that beset you are always welcome to tell.
Anyone interested in Affine and wanting to do something to bring about some changes to the world is welcome to join Affine's ambassador plan(feel free to let me know)
